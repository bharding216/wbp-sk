                    <h3>Unlocking Maximum Funding</h3>
                    <p>A key consideration for any entity is funding; getting the most result out of every scarce public dollar possible. Our team has a strong track record of maximizing state and federal funds for clients desired results. Maximizing funding requires a complete understanding of allowable and unallowable project costs. Developing work flows and project templates along with facilitating accurate project cost accounting and program compliance are key tasks. Having staff that fully understands all federal and state regulations, rules and policies related to the administration of the program and to current acceptable accounting practices is a key component to maximizing recovery and funding.</p>
                    <p>If necessary or specifically if the disaster is grant funded by a resource agency such as FEMA or HUD, a financial report will be developed to assist with monitoring the financial status of the projects that are undertaken. The report can be formatted to provide the designed level of tracking. This includes tracking project by FEMA category, areas of responsibility, funding sources etc. The financial status report can also identify cash flow and timing of reimbursements. The benefits of comprehensive reporting can improve situational awareness across the organization and lead to the cooperation, coordination and increased communication on project planning and execution.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Critical Closeouts, Done Right</h3>
                    <p>During the response phase of Hurricane Ike, our team worked closely with the Texas General Land Office to compile all documents as projects proceeded, working to reduce the time required to close out the project, thus maximizing funding and meeting audit requirements.</p>
